**Description**<br>
This box is linked to Cornell's Owl Boxes, but instead of an owl seen in a natural habitat of bark and dried moss, there is a naked blonde female plastic doll with painted red lips. The contrast between the organic environment and the doll is jarring: the setting heightens her already artifical appearance. Is she to be understood as displacing the owl? Or is she the one being displaced from her environment and trapped in another?
